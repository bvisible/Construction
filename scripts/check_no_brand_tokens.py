"""Fail the build if a competitor brand leaks in, or a named CAD tool loses its mark.

Two rules live here and they are not the same rule.

Competitor products must never appear in any commit, code, UI string, changelog
or build artifact. Internal research stays internal; everything shippable uses
neutral generic names. The hashed denylist below enforces that one.

CAD authoring tools we convert FROM are the documented exception. Naming them is
the only way to tell a user which files the pipeline actually reads, so they are
allowed in UI strings, and the founder ruling of 2026-08-14 settles the form:
the first mention in each string carries the registered sign, which is the same
treatment the marketing site has used since 2026-07. The trademark form check
enforces that one. It is deliberately hash-free, because here the word is
permitted and only its form is in question, so the report can name it outright
instead of masking it.

English reaches a user through three surfaces, and a check that guards one of
them reports green over the other two. A locale value is the surface everyone
thinks of; an i18n default inside a component is the fallback when a key is
missing, and `guide.eac.selectors.body` has no entry in any of the forty
locales, so its default is the only English that will ever render; a bare
quoted literal in a component never went through i18n at all. All three are
scanned. What is deliberately NOT marked is data: a file-format token
(RVT/DWG/IFC/DGN), a code identifier, the converter's repository slug, a
shipped release note, and a rule pack's `name`, which another file matches
against byte-for-byte.

This gate enforces both automatically so neither relies on a reviewer
remembering. It is wired into both the local pre-commit hook and CI, exactly
like ``check_version_sync.py``.

Brand-safe by design: this file stores only SHA-256 hashes of the lowercased
brand tokens, never the literal brand strings, so the denylist itself does not
put a brand name in the repo. Because SHA-256 collisions are infeasible, the gate
matches ONLY the exact brand tokens, which means it cannot raise a false positive
on an unrelated word. Generic dictionary words that happen to also be product
names are intentionally left out of the automated list (they would match the
ordinary English word) and are covered by human review instead.

When a match is found the report prints the file, line, and a MASKED form of the
token (first and last character plus length) so a developer can locate and remove
it without the log reproducing the full brand string.

Exit codes:
    0  no brand token found, and every named CAD tool carries its mark
    1  a brand token leaked, or a UI string dropped the mark (file:line listed)

Usage::

    python scripts/check_no_brand_tokens.py                # scan all tracked text files (full audit)
    python scripts/check_no_brand_tokens.py path/a path/b  # scan given files (pre-commit)
    python scripts/check_no_brand_tokens.py --since origin/main   # scan only files changed vs a ref (CI guard)

The ``--since`` mode guards against NEW leaks without failing on pre-existing
debt, which is the right way to turn the gate on while a one-time legacy cleanup
proceeds separately. Run with no args for the full audit that drives that cleanup.

# Founder ruling (2026-07): third-party product names are purged from every
# shippable surface and referred to only by open format (DWG/RVT/IFC/DGN) or a
# neutral category. CAD/BIM coordination product names are therefore denylisted
# below as well. The few genuinely load-bearing uses (our own DDC converter
# repository URL, a file-format detection value the parser compares against) are
# kept precise via the allowlist plus human review, so enforcement never breaks
# our own integration code.
#
# Amended 2026-08-14: the authoring tool the converter reads from is named in UI
# strings rather than purged, so it is deliberately absent from this list. It is
# not an oversight and must not be hashed in: the trademark form check below is
# what governs it, and hashing it would forbid the very strings that ruling
# permits.
