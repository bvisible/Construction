// One amount, one reading, on every surface that shows it.
//
// The defect this was written from: the same record rendered `$180,174.28` on
// the bill of quantities and `180.174,28 $` on the finance register, inside one
// English UI. Nothing was random about it. The bill formats through
// `shared/lib/money`, which resolves the locale from the UI language, and the
// finance register formats through `<MoneyDisplay>`, which read a separate
// `numberLocale` preference whose default was the literal `'de-DE'`. Both
// surfaces were doing exactly what they were told; they were told different
// things.
//
// So this file asks the question the sibling gates cannot. They ask whether a
// call names a locale at all - `numbersAreWrittenInTheAppLanguage` catches the
// missing argument, `formattersReadTheLocalePerCall` catches the argument read
// once at chunk load. A call that confidently passes the WRONG locale satisfies
// both. That is the shape of this bug, and it is why finding it needed a
// screenshot rather than a gate.
//
// Two halves, in one file because they are one question:
//
//   * the rendering half checks that the money surfaces agree with the common
//     path, in a form derived from the locale rather than compared to a string.
//     A test that knows `$180,174.28` passes again the moment the seed amount
//     changes; a test that knows en-US groups with commas, points its decimals
//     and leads with the symbol keeps working on any amount.
//   * the census half checks that there is only one place the answer can come
//     from. Fixing the two rows in the screenshot would have left every other
//     surface free to invent its own locale, and we would be back here.

/**

 * The rules below judge a slot by reading it, and every reading they do assumes
 * the resolver is in the slot as visible text, either called there or bound to a
 * name this same file declares. A slot holding a function parameter defeats all
 * of it, because the answer was decided in another file by whoever called in.
 * That is not a corner: `measurement-format.ts` fell in it. Its formatters read
 * `new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, opts)` where `locale` is the parameter of a
 * caching helper, so for as long as those functions defaulted to the interface
 * language the gate looked straight at them and saw nothing to say.
 *
 * So the slot gets a class of its own for "could not resolve", and the census
 * prints it. An offender list is only an answer if you also know how much of
 * the population it was drawn from, and until this existed an empty list read
 * as "clean everywhere" when part of what it meant was "unread".
 *
 * Measured when written, on the whole tree: 108 `Intl.NumberFormat`, of which 93
 * reach the preference, 1 is a literal, 1 takes the browser default and 13 are
 * unresolved; and 19 `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, of which 8 reach the language, 1
 * takes the default and 10 are unresolved. The date side is mostly unresolved
 * because `formatters.ts` and the Gantt helpers take their locale as a
 * parameter, which is the correct shape for them and unreadable from here all
 * the same. Unreadable is not the same as wrong, and the census says unresolved
 * rather than anything stronger for that reason.

 * The last codes on which the two surfaces disagreed, kept as data.
 *
 * They resolved the decimal count from different sources: the register read a
 * static ISO 4217 list, the bill read what the
 * engine holds, and CLDR gives these five zero decimals where ISO gives two.
 * That was never a contest between two tables, it was a contest between a table
 * and a reader - a Hungarian does not write forints with fillér - and on a
 * screen the reader wins, so the register asks the engine now as well. The
 * opposite rule holds for a document, which is read by a bank rather than by
 * our user, and is written down with the code that writes one, in
 * `money_decimals` in the backend einvoice rules.
 *
 * Eleven other codes used to sit beside these - BHD CLP ISK JOD JPY KRW KWD OMR
 * TND UGX VND - because the bill asked for two decimals on everything, showing
 * cents on yen and hiding a digit on dinars.
