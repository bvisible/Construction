"""Optional embedded PostgreSQL runtime - a real PG16 in-process, no Docker.

Boots a PostgreSQL 16 cluster from the ``pixeltable-pgserver`` wheel (bundled PG
binaries) and points the app's ``DATABASE_URL`` / ``DATABASE_SYNC_URL`` at it, so
the whole app runs on PostgreSQL with zero external setup. This is the default
runtime; the operator opts out only by supplying an external ``DATABASE_URL`` or
setting ``OE_USE_EMBEDDED_PG`` to a falsy value (see :func:`is_requested`).

The cluster's data directory is ``<data_dir>/pgdata`` so it survives restarts.
On first boot ``initdb`` runs once (a few seconds); subsequent boots attach to the
existing cluster.

Ordering contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``app.database`` builds the SQLAlchemy engine from ``settings.database_url`` at
*import time*. :func:`boot` therefore MUST run before the first ``from app...``
import that pulls in ``app.database`` (and before ``get_settings()`` is cached).
The CLI calls it from ``_setup_env``, which every command runs before importing
any app module - so the contract holds for ``serve``/``init-db``/``seed``.

Single-process only: run ONE uvicorn worker with embedded PG (the default). For
multi-worker deployments use an external PostgreSQL and set ``DATABASE_URL``
directly.
