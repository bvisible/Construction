"""Ask one question of every country-shaped registry in the product.

The product has several registries that vary by country, each invented where it
was needed and each with its own shape: a tuple of dicts with a ``country_code``
field, a dict keyed by region code with a ``DEFAULT`` entry, a dict of functions,
a seeded JSON file. Nothing could answer "is Canada covered", and the answer
turned out to be "it has a working calendar and no payment regime" - which
nobody had noticed, because there was nowhere to look.

**This module centralises the question and not the data.** Every registry stays
where it is and keeps its own shape; a probe here knows how to ask it. Adding a
country is still an edit in the owning module. That is the plugin principle and
this file does not trade it.

Reading a report
----------------

The six verdicts are deliberately not collapsible into "yes / no", because the
useful distinctions are between the shades of no:

``COVERED``      the registry has a row of this country's own.
``FALLBACK``     something resolves for this country, but by default or alias
                 rather than on its own terms. A caller sees an answer and
                 cannot tell it was not written for them.
``MISSING``      the registry is country-keyed, is populated, and this country
                 is not in it.
``NOT_KEYED``    the registry exists and has no country axis at all, so the
                 question cannot be put to it. Wanting a per-country answer here
                 means changing its shape, not adding a row.
``ABSENT``       no such registry exists anywhere in the product.
``UNRESOLVED``   the probe could not answer. An import failed, a symbol moved,
                 or a shape changed.

``UNRESOLVED`` is counted separately from ``MISSING`` everywhere, and that
separation is the point of the file. An instrument that reports what it could
not measure as an absence tells you a comfortable lie: it converts "I do not
know" into "there is nothing there", and the second reads as a finished
question. Unmeasured and fine are different words.

An empty population is treated as ``UNRESOLVED`` rather than as "every country
is missing", for the same reason. A probe that finds nothing at all has almost
certainly broken, and a registry that genuinely emptied is worth the same alarm.

# Resolving a registry that lives in a module you cannot import
#
# Several of these registries are plain literals sitting in a service module,
# and importing that module pulls in the database configuration. On a developer
# machine with no cluster running, three probes came back UNRESOLVED for that
# reason alone - which is honest but useless, because the registries themselves
# are static and perfectly readable.
#
# So: import first, because that reads the object the product actually runs on,
# and read the file directly when the import will not come - by parse for a
# structural question, or by executing the registry's own definitions alone for
# a behavioural one. The report says which one answered, because an import and
# a read of the file on disk are not equally good evidence.
#
# WHERE A SOURCE READ IS ALLOWED, AND WHERE IT IS NOT. Parsing a table answers
# structural questions - does this table have a country axis at all, how many
# rungs does this ladder have - because those are properties of what is
# written. It must never stand in for a behavioural question by reading a table
# the behaviour does not read directly, because behaviour can sit in aliasing
# layers the table knows nothing about. calendar.schedule_regions is the worked
# example: sixteen of the eighteen countries on its axis are not keys of the
# table at all, so a membership test on the table calls sixteen countries
# uncovered while the resolver returns a real calendar for every one of them.
#
# Executing the resolver itself is a different act and is allowed. When the
# owning module will not import, that probe runs get_work_calendar and the maps
# it reads, alone, out of the same file - the product's own behaviour, run
# rather than guessed at from a neighbouring table. It is still labelled
# "source", because what ran is the file on disk and not the object the live
# process is holding.
#
# WHY A PROBE IS STILL ALLOWED TO REFUSE. If the import succeeds and the symbol
# is gone, the AttributeError propagates and the dimension comes back
# UNRESOLVED. Read that as the instrument working, not as a bug in it. A
# renamed registry is a real finding about the tree, and the second path exists
# to survive a missing database rather than to route around a missing name:
# reaching for it there would turn "this registry moved" into a confident
# answer assembled out of whatever the old name still matched. A probe that
# refuses is a probe reporting that it could not measure, which is the one
# thing this whole file is for.

    ``GB``), regional blocs (``DACH``, ``GULF``) and English country names

    overlap, one holding ISO country codes and one holding superseded catalogue
    codes that are not and cannot be ISO codes. So membership of the table is
    not the question a caller asks.
