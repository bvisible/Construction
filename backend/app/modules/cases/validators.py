"""Cases module validation rules.

A case scenario is teaching material, and the ways it goes wrong are not syntax
errors: it opens screens without saying why, it claims five minutes for twenty
steps, it walks the same page three times. None of that stops a case being
saved, and none of it can be caught by a schema.

So the rules run on save and the findings come back with the saved case, and
they are a **gate on one action only**: publishing. A private draft may be as
rough as its author likes. Sharing a case with the team is a claim that it is
worth someone's time, and an ERROR finding contradicts that claim.

Rules, all registered under the ``cases`` rule set:

* ``cases.has_steps``         - ERROR.   A case with no steps teaches nothing.
* ``cases.step_titled``       - ERROR.   Every step needs a title and a target.
* ``cases.step_purpose``      - WARNING. A step with no "why" is a click
                                          instruction, not a walkthrough.
* ``cases.distinct_screens``  - WARNING. Consecutive steps on the same screen
                                          read as one step to the follower.
* ``cases.duration_plausible``- WARNING. The stated minutes should survive
                                          contact with the step count.
* ``cases.described``         - WARNING. A case needs a summary to be findable.
