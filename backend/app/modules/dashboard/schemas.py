"""Pydantic schemas for the dashboard rollup endpoint.

Each widget has its own concrete shape so the OpenAPI doc is useful, but
the top-level response (``RollupResponse``) keys are dynamic — only the
widgets the caller asked for are populated. Unrequested widgets are
absent (not ``None``) so the frontend can use ``in`` to detect coverage.

All money fields ship as **strings**, never floats, per CLAUDE.md §10:
JS ``Number`` loses precision on currency values > 2^53, and ``orjson``
defaults can stringify-without-rounding nondeterministically.
