"""Compliance rule packs for contract gates.

A *rule pack* is a jurisdiction-scoped bundle of validation rule-SET ids
(the same set names the core :class:`ValidationEngine` already knows -
``boq_quality``, ``din276``, ``gaeb``, ``nrm``, ``masterformat`` …). Each
pack also declares which workflow gates enforce it (currently only
``contract_signature``).

These packs are deterministic seed data, not user-authored DSL - they map a
project's region to a concrete, runnable set of validation rules so the
compliance gate that runs on a contract ``draft → active`` transition has
something real to execute. A project picks which packs it enforces via the
``Project.compliance_rule_packs`` JSON column; the gate resolves the union
of every pack's ``rule_sets`` and feeds them to the validation engine.

Design choices:
    * ``rule_sets`` reference rule sets that genuinely exist in the engine's
      registry. Unknown set names are simply skipped by the engine
      (``get_rules_for_sets`` ignores them), so a pack can declare an
      aspirational set without crashing - but the shipped packs only list
      sets we actually register, so the gate always evaluates real rules.
    * The ``universal`` pack is the safe default for any project with no
      region match - it enforces the cross-market ``boq_quality`` rule set.
    * Region → pack auto-mapping is a *suggestion*; projects can override.

#: Default pack every project falls back to when nothing else matches.
DEFAULT_PACK_ID = "universal"

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Pack resolution: three keyspaces that cannot overlap.
#
# A project carries an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 ``country_code`` (a controlled value)
# and a free-text ``region`` (whatever somebody typed). Resolution reads the
# ISO column first and treats the region label as a fallback only.
#
# This used to be one table of substrings matched against the region alone, and
# two of its entries were two letters long. ``de`` matched the Spanish and
# French preposition, so "Ciudad de Mexico" and "Ile-de-France" both enforced
# the German pack, and ``us`` matched inside "Russia", "Australia", "Belarus"
# and "Cyprus", all of which enforced the American one. The tables below cannot
# repeat that: nothing here is ever matched as a bare substring. ISO codes and
# legacy codes match a whole string, labels match a whole word or phrase, and
# no two-letter token appears in the label table at all - so the order the
# tables are consulted in does not decide any answer.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

#: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code → pack id. Matched exactly, never as a
#: substring. Seeded from each pack's own ``jurisdiction`` so there is one
#: source of truth for which pack covers which country, then extended with the
#: countries a pack covers beyond the one it is named for.
#:
#: On the ambiguity of ``DE``: ``Project.country_code`` is NOT NULL with
#: ``server_default='DE'``, and it has three states that look like two. A
#: project created through the API with no country chosen holds 'DE' from the
#: default; a project created through the demo path holds '' because an empty
#: string does not trigger a server default; and a project whose owner really
#: did choose Germany also holds 'DE'. Explicit Germany is therefore
#: indistinguishable from never-chosen in the row. We resolve 'DE' at face
#: value, because demoting it would break every real German project in order to
#: protect the ones that never chose, and we treat '' as unknown. Fixing the
#: ambiguity properly needs a nullable column or a separate "chosen" marker,
#: which is a migration and not a resolver change. Note that ``currency`` in
#: the same model deliberately defaults to '' with the comment "No EUR bias";
#: ``country_code`` did not get the same treatment.
