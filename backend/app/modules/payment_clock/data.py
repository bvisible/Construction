"""The shipped statutory payment regimes, and an idempotent seeder for them.

This is where the law is written down. Every number here is a statutory default
and every entry names the sections it came from, because the one question a
quantity surveyor will ask about a computed date is which provision produced
it. Nothing here is a house rule.

Two modelling decisions run through the whole table and are worth stating once
rather than once per regime.

**The due date and the final date for payment are different dates, and only the
UK Act genuinely splits them.** The UK Act makes a sum fall due, then gives a
further period before it must be paid, and the notice deadlines hang off both.
The security-of-payment statutes have one date: the progress payment "becomes
due and payable" a set number of days after the claim. Those regimes are
therefore written with the due date on the application date and the statutory
period as the final date for payment, which is what the statute actually
imposes - a last day to pay - and which keeps the final date after the due date
in every regime shipped.

**A null deadline means the statute is silent, which is not the same as zero.**
Malaysia leaves the payment period to the contract, and the EU Late Payment
Directive and the German regimes have no notice sequence at all. The rules skip
what the regime does not set rather than treating it as an instant deadline.

Seed data lives here and not in a migration on purpose: a migration is a
schema change that runs once per deployment, and this table is content that
will be corrected as statutes are amended.
