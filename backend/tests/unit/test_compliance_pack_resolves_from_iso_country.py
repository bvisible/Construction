"""Compliance pack resolution keys off the ISO country column, not free text.

A project carries both ``country_code`` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, a controlled
value) and ``region`` (free text somebody types). Pack selection used to read
only ``region``, and it read it by substring, so the pack a project enforced
depended on how its region label happened to be spelled. Two two-letter tokens
did the damage: ``de`` matched the Spanish and French preposition, so "Ciudad
de Mexico" and "Ile-de-France" both enforced the German pack, and ``us``
matched inside "Russia" and "Australia", which both enforced the American one.

The fix is the same shape as the one in the schedule calendars: two keyspaces
that cannot overlap. ISO codes are matched exactly against a country table,
human labels are matched whole-word against a label table, and no two-letter
token is ever substring-matched again.

    Resolving from the ISO column is correct and still gives these projects the

    GB/T 50500 for China, FIEBDC-3 for Spain. Those rules are selectable today
    through a project's ``validation_rule_sets``; what no jurisdiction reaches
    is the contract-signature gate, which is fed by packs alone.

    THIS TEST IS MEANT TO GO RED when a pack is added. It is not an obstacle,
    it is the checklist. Before deleting a code from this list, confirm:

    1. The pack's ``rule_sets`` name sets the engine actually registers.
       ``ValidationEngine.has_rules(name)`` is the check; an unregistered set
       does not run and must never read as "ran and passed".
    2. Those rules test something the jurisdiction is about, not only that a
       classification code is present and shaped like a code. A gate that
       passes everything is worse than no gate, because an absent pack reads
       as absent while an empty one reads as coverage.
    3. A country added here is one whose projects should be *blocked* at
       contract signature by those rules, not merely one the product supports.

    If all three hold, add the ISO code to PACK_BY_COUNTRY and drop it here.
