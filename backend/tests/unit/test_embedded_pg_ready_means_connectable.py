"""A cluster counts as ready when it answers, not when a function returns.

Attaching to an embedded cluster reads the cluster's own files. A data
directory left describing a postmaster that no longer exists therefore hands
back a perfectly well formed server object pointing at a port where nothing is
listening. The stage that announces the database then fires on the strength of
that object, and the very next connection fails, so the user is told the local
database is ready and the application server is not, in the same breath. Two
users on two different data directories saw exactly that pair of statements.

The recovery path already proved readiness by opening a socket. The happy path
did not, which is the whole defect: the check existed and was wired only to the
branch where something had already gone visibly wrong.

The blind spot of this file: it stubs the attach, so it tests the decision this
module makes about a returned server, not pixeltable's behaviour when it
returns one. Whether a real cluster comes back after the retry clears the
leftovers is covered where a real cluster is started.
