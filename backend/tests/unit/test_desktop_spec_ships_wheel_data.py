"""The desktop bundle must ship the runtime data the wheel force-includes.

A wheel and a frozen sidecar are two ways of shipping one backend, and they
collect files by two unrelated mechanisms. Hatchling walks the ``app`` package
and adds whatever ``force-include`` names on top of it; PyInstaller adds only
what ``desktop/pyinstaller.spec`` lists. Anything the runtime reads from a path
that resolves OUTSIDE the ``app`` package therefore has to be named twice, once
in each file, and until this test there was nothing that made the second naming
happen.

It is written against a failure that reached users. ``app/core/i18n.py``
resolves its catalogue as a ``locales`` directory sitting NEXT TO the ``app``
package, the wheel force-included it, and the spec never did, so no desktop
build had ever carried it. That stayed invisible while a missing catalogue was
a warning that refilled the directory from an embedded copy, and became a
sidecar that exits during startup the moment refilling was correctly replaced
by a hard error. Both halves were defensible on their own; nothing compared
them.

The spec is executed rather than read. A test that greps the spec for a path
passes on a spec that computes the same path and then never appends it, which
is the failure mode being guarded against, so the real module runs with the
PyInstaller API stubbed out and the assertions read the list it actually built.

Blind spot, stated here rather than left to be rediscovered: the denominator is
the wheel's force-include map. A directory the runtime reads that is missing
from BOTH files has no anchor and is invisible to this test. ``alembic.ini`` is
exactly that case today, and its absence is deliberate on both sides: the
frozen bundle carries no ``alembic/`` script directory, so shipping the ini
alone would turn ``stamp_head_if_unstamped``'s graceful "cannot locate it, skip
stamping" into an exception raised during startup.

That reads as a tidy-up somebody will eventually propose, so here is what it
would actually cost, measured rather than reasoned. The ini sets
``script_location = %(here)s/alembic``. Copy it into a directory with no
``alembic/`` beside it and ``ScriptDirectory.from_config`` raises
``CommandError: Path doesn't exist``. In ``stamp_head_if_unstamped`` that raise
lands AFTER ``ensure_wide_version_table`` has issued its ALTER, and main.py runs
the whole thing inside one ``async with engine.begin()``, so the transaction
rolls back and the version-table widening of issue #399 is undone on every boot
of an upgraded database - while the caller's ``except Exception:
logger.debug(...)`` keeps it off the log. The health check would start warning
on every 30s poll as well. Neither deployment gains anything in exchange:
``pip install`` and the desktop app never run migrations at all (create_all plus
``postgres_auto_migrate`` plus the stamp), and the Docker image, which is the
one deployment that does, carries both halves: ``tests/unit/test_dockerignore.py``
names ``backend/alembic.ini`` AND ``backend/alembic/env.py`` among the paths the
build context must keep, and ``alembic.ini`` AND ``alembic/env.py`` among the
paths that must be present inside the image. The ini is shipped
exactly where its script tree is and withheld exactly where it is not. If that
is ever to change, both have to move together and the 327 version files are the
real cost, not this line.
