"""What the DDC DWG parser keeps, and what it throws away.

A v12.6.1 report said DWG files upload but the drawing does not look like the
source. Nothing covered ``parse_ddc_dwg_excel``, so every fidelity loss was
invisible to the suite. These tests pin the current behaviour: the parts that
are correct stay correct, and each known loss is asserted explicitly so that
whoever repairs it sees exactly one test turn red per repair.

class TestRotationIsRadiansOnTheWire:
    """The wire format is radians, and this path was not converting to it.

    ``dxf-renderer.ts`` hands ``entity.rotation`` straight to ``ctx.rotate``,
    which takes radians, so the unit is not a preference here. The DXF path was
    fixed to convert; a comment in ``dxf_processor.py`` states that this parser
    already emitted radians, and it did not.

    The export writes an angle either as a bare number already in radians or
    with a ``d`` suffix meaning degrees, which is why the ARC branch reads its
    start and end angles through ``_parse_angle``. Rotation was read through
    ``_safe_float`` instead. ``float("90.0d")`` raises, ``_safe_float`` answers
    None, and ``or 0.0`` turned that into an unrotated entity, so a drawing
    whose export used the suffix form came back with every label upright and
    every block facing the same way, with nothing logged.

    Nothing caught it because the only rotation assertion in this file used a
    fixture that left the cell blank and asserted 0.0, and zero is zero in both
    units. An assertion that cannot tell the two apart is not a units test.
