"""Tests for the country coverage manifest.

These test the instrument, not the coverage. A country having no payment regime
is a finding for the register and not a failure here; the manifest reporting it
as covered, or reporting a broken probe as a gap, is a failure here.

The one property everything else rests on: **UNRESOLVED must never present as
MISSING.** An instrument that turns "I could not measure this" into "there is
nothing there" hands back a finished-looking answer to an unasked question, and
every count downstream of it is wrong in the comfortable direction.
