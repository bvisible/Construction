"""Pin which test trees a blocking push lane actually runs.

A test that no lane names does not fail. It reports nothing at all, and an
absent signal is indistinguishable from a green one when you are reading a
list of check marks. Several trees under ``backend/tests`` are in exactly
that position: they are reached only by the bare ``pytest`` in the nightly
full suite, so a break in them is invisible on the commit that caused it.

This does not argue that every tree belongs in the push lane. Some of them
genuinely should not be there, because the push lane has a time budget. What
it argues is that the split should be a decision somebody wrote down, not an
accident of which paths happened to get typed into a workflow file. So the
map below is pinned. Moving a tree between classes is allowed and is
sometimes the right change, but it has to be an edit to this file, which
means it shows up in review instead of drifting.

The workflow files are read as text. Asking GitHub what it ran would be a
better source and is not available from a test, so the honest limit of this
guard is that it checks the configuration and not the runner.
